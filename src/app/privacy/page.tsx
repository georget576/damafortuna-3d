              <Section title="Data Security">
                <p>
                  We take your privacy and security extremely seriously. DamaFortuna 3D implements comprehensive, industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information at every stage of your interaction with our platform. Your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using advanced encryption protocols, ensuring that even if unauthorized access were attempted, your information would remain unreadable and protected. We employ regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and follow best practices for data storage and handling. Our infrastructure is designed with multiple layers of protection, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure authentication mechanisms. We also maintain strict access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel with legitimate business purposes can access your data, and all access is carefully monitored and logged.

              <Section title="Third-Party Services">
                <p>
                  To provide you with a seamless and secure authentication experience, DamaFortuna 3D integrates with Google's authentication services. When you choose to sign in with Google, we only request access to your basic profile information such as your name and email addressâ€”nothing more. This information is used exclusively for account creation and verification purposes, allowing you to bypass traditional password-based authentication while maintaining security. We do not access, store, or use any other Google profile data, including your contacts, calendar information, Google Drive files, or any other personal Google services. Your Google credentials are never stored on our servers; instead, we rely on Google's secure OAuth protocol to handle the authentication process. You retain full control over what information is shared, and you can revoke access to DamaFortuna 3D from your Google account settings at any time.
